is.js is a tiny (188 bytes) strict type checker/engine which offer a little API to test JavaScript types as well as allows the creation of custom type checkers.

Basic API explained below see tests.js for more test cases.

Builder
-------------

 is._(string);
  - create one custom type checker function
  - example:
  
	var C = function(){},
		D = function(){};
		
	is._('C');
	is._('D');
	
	console.log(is.c(new C) === true);
	console.log(is.d(new D) === true);
